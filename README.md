#                       ABOUT CURL
# cURL Supported Operations
For handling remote file access, the cURL as an intermediary is used for,

Form submitting
Authentication
File upload
File transfer
Without cURL, we can use PHP file system functionsallow_url_fopen configuration directive which is not preferable because of security reasons. For example, file_get_contents() returns remote data including some untrusted internet content.

# PHP cURL Delimiters
In a PHP program, the cURL portion should be enclosed within this two pair of functions.

$ch = curl_init(URL Syntax);
...
curl_close($ch);
The curl_init() function returns cURL session handle with respect to the given file URL. And then, curl_close() function will be an end delimiter to close cURL session with respect to its handle.

# cURL Options
PHP curl_setopt() function is used to set options. It receives cURL handle, option’s name and value as its parameters.

We can use another cURL function curl_setopt_array() to set an array of multiple options at a push.

curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1);
# cURL Option Constants
CURLOPT_FILE – target file to write cURL result.
CURLOPT_URL – URL from where we need to get data. If this URL is specified with curl_init(), then no need to set this option
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER – to return the result in string format into a variable instead of printing it to the browser.
CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER – to set header fields as an array.
CURLOPT_POST – set to TRUE to perform HTTP POST.
CURLOPT_USERPWD – to set username/password if required to connect remote server.
php_curl

# PHP cURL Request
Like PHP, the GET and POST methods are used for sending cURL request where GET is the default. The CURLOPT_POST constant is used for sending POST request. And the parameters CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS is for sending parameter array of the field: value pairs.

cURL Execution
After setting request methods and parameters, curl_exec() function is used for executing cURL request.

$result = curl_exec($ch);
This function returns either boolean values or string data based on the value of option CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER.
